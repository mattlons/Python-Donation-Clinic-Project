# Python-Donation-Clinic-Project

The **Blood Compatibility Checker** is a Python-powered tool designed to quickly determine blood type compatibility for donors and receivers.
With just a few inputs, users can discover who they can donate to or receive blood from,
making it perfect for educational purposes or as a handy reference for medical contexts.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **üîç Donor Compatibility**: Find out which blood types you can donate to based on your blood type.
- **üì• Receiver Compatibility**: Learn which blood types you can receive from.
- **ü§ñ Interactive User Input**: A simple terminal-based interface to enter your details and get instant results.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling**: Validates inputs to ensure a smooth and frustration-free experience.

## üìÇ Project Structure
### 1. Compatibility Rules
Two dictionaries store compatibility data:
- `donor_compatibility`: Maps blood types to the types they can donate to.
- `receiver_compatibility`: Maps blood types to the types they can receive from.

### 2. Main Functionality
- **Input Collection**: Gathers the user's name, role (donor or receiver), and blood type.
- **Validation**: Checks for valid roles and blood types.
- **Compatibility Display**: Outputs personalized results based on the input.

### 3. Execution
- Fully interactive, running in a terminal or command-line environment.
- Provides real-time compatibility feedback.

## üåü Why This Project?
I created this project to showcase my coding abilities using Python and as a part of my long term goal of having a high-quality Github Portfolio

---

## Challenges
Although simple, the part I struggled the most in this part was creating and understanding how libraries work. Using trial and error I was able to get a 
good grasp of its usage and usability cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience.
- Integrate a database for storing user profiles and donation records.
- Expand functionality to support Rh factor compatibility details.
